### Project description:
Welcome to the high or low game project, in this project you will have to create the high or low game in C language, so what is the high or low game ? the principle of this game is to generate a random number depending on the difficulty, then the user tries to guess it, and in each try, the program informs the user if his number is too high or too low or is the right number, and when the user wins the program asks him if he wants to play again, so let me give you the steps and you have to create the program, first you ask the user about the difficulty : easy, medium or hard, then you generate a random number, between 1 and 100 if the diffuclty is easy, between 1 and 1000 if medium, and between 1 and 10000 if hard, then the game begins, you ask the user to guess the number and tell him if it's too high or too low until he finds the generated number, after it you display a congratulations message with the number of tries the user did, and finally you ask him if he wants to play again.
